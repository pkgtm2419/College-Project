			<p>IIT is considerd as the world's most elite institution for the studies of Science and Techonology. Admission to the college in engineering in any state and university is considerd as second only to IIT. It has been decided to hold a Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) from the year 2013 for admission to the undergraduate programmes in Engineering in two parts, JEE-MAIN and JEE-ADVANCED. Only the top 150000 candidates based on performance in JEE MAIN will qualify to appear in the JEE ADVANCED examination.</p>
<p><b>Eligibility :</b></p>

<p>A Student appearing or appeared in the final examination of 10+2 system ( XII of any recognized Central/State Board with Physics, Chemistry and Maths can appear in JEE( Main). Only the top 150000 candidates based on performance in JEE MAIN will qualify to appear in the JEE ADVANCED examination.</p>

<p>Admissions to IITs will be based only on category-wise All India Rank (AIR) in JEE ADVANCED, subject to condition that such candidates are in the top 20 percentile (category wise) in their respective Boards/Qualifying Examinations.</p>

<p><b>Exam Pattern-2012 : </b></p>
<p> JEE-2012 had two papers; each had three parts - Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. In both the papers, The IIT JEE 2012 was of 401 Marks (P-136, C-133, M-132) Only those candidate who attempted both paper 1 and paper 2 were considered for preparing merit list s. The marks obtained by a candidate in Chemistry, Mathematics and Physics are considered to be sum of the marks obtained in the corresponding parts in Paper 1 and Paper 2. The sum of the marks obtained in the individual subjects in JEE will be the aggregate mark for the candidate. The average of the marks scored by all such candidates was computed for each of the three subjects. These are the Minimum Qualifying Marks for Ranking (MQMR) in the individual subjects. The MQMR (Subject wise cut off) in Physics, Chemistry and Maths and for the JEE-2012 are 17, 16 & 13. Thus, a candidate is qualified for ranking without relaxed norms only when he / she scored at least 17, 16 & 13 marks in Physics, Chemistry and Maths respectively.</p>
