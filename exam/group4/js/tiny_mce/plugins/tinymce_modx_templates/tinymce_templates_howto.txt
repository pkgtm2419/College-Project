   tinymce_templates_howto.txt
   
   This modification allows custom pre made templates to be used in your tinymce editor
   
   Unzip the package on your local comp, file structure should be as follows:
   
   -- tinymce_modx_templates
       * tinymce_templates_howto.txt

     the following folder structure matches the tinymce3101 in the plugins folder

     tinymce3101
        - tinymce.functions.php (modified and commented, so back up your original in case)
        * lists/      + files
        * templates/  + files
        * plugins/template/ (this folder may already be in there, I added it just in case)
   

  Upload the files in the tinymce3101 folder to your server keeping the same folder structure
  
  The following additions are only needed if you use the editor in custom mode
  Go into your manager/configuration/interface and features/
   at the end of the custom plugins field, add     ,template
   at the end of the buttons2 line add             ,template
   
  To add new templates, create your new template and save it in the templates/ folder.
  Modify the lists/template_list.js file so your new template is listed.
